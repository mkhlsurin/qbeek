Qbeek Users API

A minimal TypeScript + Express API with MongoDB. 

Runs locally with Docker Compose in several commands.

There is a script to seed the first admin. 

Tech:

Node.js 22+, TypeScript, Express
MongoDB 7 (via Docker)
Mongoose
JWT auth (access/refresh)
Postman collection for endpoints (instead of Swagger) as JSON

Requirements:

Docker & Docker Compose
(Optional for local dev) Node.js 22+, npm


Quick start:

# 1) Create envs from template
cp .env.example .env

# 2) Start API + Mongo
docker compose up --build -d

# 3) Seed the first Admin
docker compose run --rm api npm run seed


Environment variables used by seeding come from .env:

SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL,
SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD,
SEED_ADMIN_NAME
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS
DATABASE_URL 
JWT SECRETS
JWT EXPIRE TIME

Re-running wonâ€™t duplicate the admin.

Stop the project:

# 1) Stop and remove this project's containers & network
docker compose down

# 2) Remove this project's volumes (DELETES DB DATA)
docker compose down --volumes

Note:

The production container installs production deps only; dev tools (e.g., tsx, ts-node-dev) are not present inside the runtime image!

Tests in Postman:

Authorization via Bearer AccessToken (granted with login by email and password)
